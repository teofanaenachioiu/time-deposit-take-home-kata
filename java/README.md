# Time Deposit

Spring Boot application for managing time deposits and updating their balances based on plan-specific interest rules.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Java 25
- Maven 3.6.3 or newer
- PostgreSQL running locally on `localhost:5432`
- Docker running if you want to execute the integration tests based on Testcontainers

The application expects this database configuration:

- Database name: `time_deposits`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `postgres`

You only need to create the database itself. The tables and seed data are created automatically by Flyway on startup.

Example PostgreSQL setup with Docker:

```bash
docker run --name time-deposit-db \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=time_deposits \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:16
```

## Run the Project

Start the application from the project root:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application starts on:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

## Run the Tests

Run unit tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run the full verification pipeline, including integration tests:

```bash
mvn verify
```

Note: integration tests require Docker because they use Testcontainers.

## Trigger the Endpoints Using Swagger

After the application is running, open the Swagger UI:

```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

### Available endpoints

Base path:

```text
/api/v1/time-deposits
```

Endpoints exposed by the API:

- `GET /api/v1/time-deposits` - returns all time deposits together with their withdrawals
- `POST /api/v1/time-deposits/update-balances` - recalculates and persists updated balances for all deposits

### How to call them from Swagger UI

1. Open `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
2. Expand the `Time Deposits` section
3. Choose the endpoint you want to run
4. Click `Try it out`
5. Click `Execute`

Expected behavior:

- `GET /api/v1/time-deposits` returns a `200 OK` response with the seeded deposits and their withdrawals
- `POST /api/v1/time-deposits/update-balances` returns `204 No Content` and updates balances in the database

If you want to confirm the updated values, trigger the `POST` endpoint first and then call `GET /api/v1/time-deposits` again from Swagger.

```

## Trade-Offs

`TimeDeposit`
- `TimeDeposit` was kept close to the initial structure.
- The domain model still uses `Double` for `balance`, while the database stores money as `DECIMAL`.
- To keep calculations safer, interest is calculated with `BigDecimal` in the calculator, then converted back to `Double` when the updated balance is written into the domain object.
- This works for the current scope, but it is not ideal for money values because it adds conversion steps and can still introduce precision risk in the domain model.

`updateAllTimeDepositsBalance()`
- `updateAllTimeDepositsBalance()` currently loads all deposits into memory before recalculating and saving them.
- This is acceptable for a small dataset, but it does not scale well for large volumes of data.
- A better approach would be to process deposits in pages or batches, for example by reading a limited number of rows, updating them, saving them, and then moving to the next batch.

## Seed Data

On startup, Flyway loads a small initial dataset:

- 5 time deposits
- withdrawals linked to some of those deposits

This allows you to trigger the Swagger endpoints immediately after startup without inserting data manually.
